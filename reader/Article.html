    If you're not familiar with German influencer Pamela Reif's workouts, know they rack up anywhere between 1 and 45 million views on YouTube. Renowned for sharing simple to follow workouts, 24-year old Reif has a gaggle of over 7.4 million subscribers. Woof.
    <br><br>
    Whether you want to virtually sweat with her in her living room – the signature style of a Pamela Reif workout – or tune in for a sunset stretch on the bow of a yacht (not a joke, she did that), Pam's got you covered.
    <br><br>
    Over the last four years Reif's shared reams of workouts to her YouTube channel to rapturous response. Credited with everything from providing challenging home workouts to being better than her YouTube peer, Chloe Ting, she's Stanned. Hard.
    <br>
    I walked with Chloe so I could run with Pamela,' one viewer comments whilst another mentions seeing expedited bodily change after switching to Reif's workouts.
    <br><br>
    The one catch to her offering? She's not actually a qualified personal trainer. Because of this, we've asked a couple of certified PTs to give their verdict on her sessions. Safety first, people!
    <br><br>
    Of course, part of her mammoth following has to be credited to the fact she has an aesthetic desired by many – strong, lean and fit, with visible muscle definition and glam that just doesn't seem to slip. Inspirational, yes. Achievable? I wasn't so sure.
    <br><br>
    Rather than watch her view count roll up (and up and up and up) from the sidelines, I thought I'd jump in, trying her three most viewed YouTube workouts ever. Each video had over 35 million views and fortunately targeted a different body part each time.
    <br><br>
    Could I do it? Would it all be worth it? Read on, dear reader. Read on.

    After waking up late, a quick core workout was exactly what my morning needed. Speedy, efficient and I probably wouldn't have to shower afterwards. Job's a good'un.
    <br><br>
    Jumping in, I was surprised to find out that Reif says (and I stress the 'nothing' part of this) absolutely nothing during the entire workout. No explanations, no encouraging platitudes, just the dulcet beat of unplaceable Ibiza-esque club music.
    <br><br>
    I wasn't against it but I was surprised. Usually, a trainer injects their personality through motivational shouting and the occasional berating. It's friendly and terrifying and motivating in equal, unrelenting waves.
    <br><br>
    But, classic her, Pamela Reif was swan-like, all cool and calm. Whilst I sweated, she glowed. When I moaned about being hungry and wanting to stop to eat breakfast, Reif remained composed, moving without fault or pause. K, then.
    <br><br>
    Now for the breakdown. A mix of crunches, reverse crunches, planks and twists, my core (and upper arms) were shot by the end of the ten minutes. And, whilst it wasn't different to other ab-based workouts I've done, it was made more questionable by Reif's complete lack of coaching insight throughout. Without any form tips or set-up explanations (or a nearby mirror), it was impossible to know if I was doing the moves correctly or just wildly flailing around. Most likely a mix of both.
    <br><br>
    The next day I was sore as hell. My core ached, but more than that, I felt stiff, as if I had engaged too many ancillary muscles and not targeted the ones I had been meaning to. Error.
    <br>
    Although, I found myself still bopping to the tunes post-workout, so that's a good thing.

    The second workout in the great Reif experiment coincided with the start of my period and the onslaught of accompanying pain. Super fun. By the time I'd finished work and washed down a couple of painkillers, the last thing I wanted to do was get sweaty. Honestly, I just wanted to fall face-first into some pasta and then my bed.

    Instead, I stayed the course and set up for a 10-minute glute-focused workout. Starting with some pulse lunges, my quads fired up and an inkling that this was going to be more difficult than expected crept in.
    
    Throw in some jump squats, sumo squats and kickbacks and glute bridges, and we had ourselves a SULA (sweaty upper lip alert).
  <br><br>
  My bum, you ask? On fire, mate. Pure flames.

A mix of heart-raising lower body exercises and activation moves, my glutes were engaged and I found myself sweatier than I had anticipated. By the end of the ten minutes I was properly warmed through and feeling limber.
<br><br>
Once again, the no-talking element was interesting.

For a beginner, it would be difficult to know how to do the moves correctly without any sort of explanation. But at the end of a long, highly menstrual day, I wasn't fussed. The music pulled me through and there was the promise of carbohydrates soon after. I was content to challenge some of the largest muscles in my body for ten minutes and ten minutes only. Roll on bedtime.

    Workout three and I was ready to sweat. I'd woken up happy, rested and without the pre-menstrual tension that characterised my first two fitness forays. In fact, I felt positively positive!
    <br><br>
    This time, I was ready for Reif's total silence and, full disclosure, I really enjoyed it.

Early on a Friday morning, with emails already flying in, focusing on doing each exercise correctly was really all my brain could handle pre-caffeine.
<br><br>
The same format as her other two most popular workouts, Reif performed each exercise for 30 seconds before rolling straight onto the next. This time we were treated to two 60-second breaks which was laavley.
<br><br>
The workout started with lower body cardio exercises. Think squat jumps, plank jumps, squats with kicks, jumping jacks and commandos. Then, once warm, Reif moved onto slower, strength-focused exercises targeting the glutes, back and core.
<br><br>
The range of moves was great and I felt challenged enough to not clock watch. Some exercises were more advanced than others – a side plank with side crunch at the same time, for example. And, because of this (and the zero instruction from Reif), it wasn't the most accessible session.
<br><br>
A sweaty, happy, hot mess afterwards, I thoroughly enjoyed the workout at the top of a busy day. Long enough to feel exerted but short enough to not raid the fridge for sustenance straight after. Winner.
